    /**
     * Prints the frequency of each unique element in a sorted integer array.
     *
     * The array must be sorted in non-decreasing order. This method counts
     * consecutive equal elements and prints their frequency. Since the array is
     * sorted, all identical elements are adjacent, allowing a single linear
     * pass without using extra data structures.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each element is visited exactly once.
     *
     * Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only a constant amount of extra variables.
     *
     * Auxiliary Space: O(1) - No recursion or additional storage is required.
     *
     * @param arr The sorted integer array whose element frequencies are to be
     * printed. If the array is empty, no output is produced.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: int[] arr = {10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30};
     *
     * Output: Frequency of 10: 3 Frequency of 20: 2 Frequency of 30: 1
